A game of Rock Paper Scissors that last for 5 rounds. Will be revisited later with the intent on improving the code by making it more clean. In this phase, main point was to write game logic which functions in the right way by using all the basics learned till now, with the focus on: variables, conditionals and functions.

Revisit: DOM manipulation, handler functions and loops.

Added an UI and restart functionality.
